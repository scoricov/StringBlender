=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<String::Blender> is an OO implementation of random generator of compound
words based on one or more priority driven word vocabularies. Originally the
module was created for the purpose of constructing new attractive thematic domain
names. Later it was used to improve dictionary attack tool.

Each vocabulary itself represents an array of single words not necessarily sorted.
All vocabularies are stored in an array within predefined order. C<String::Blender>
provides ability to load vocabularies from plain text files or set them manually.

Resulting compound words are represented as an array of uniq strings which consist
of one or more vocabulary words placed in serial or random order; probably
prefixed, followed and/or separated by defined strings.

Construction of one compound word can be briefly described like this:

=over

=item * Define random number of elements within a given set of constraints.

=item * Address each vocabulary list in a row up to the defined number of
elements and take one random word per vocabulary. Once the number of future
component words exceeds the number of vocabularies, then take each next word
from random vocabulary.

=item * Concatenate selected words and/or join them with delimiter, add
prefix and postfix if defined.

=item * Check the length of the resulting word. Retry attempt if it's too long
or too short.

=back


=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 Class methods

=over 4

=item * B<new (%config)>

The C<new> constructor method instantiates a new C<String::Blender> object.
A hash array of configuration attributes may be passed as a parameter.
See the </ATTRIBUTES> section.

=back


=head2 Object methods

=over 4

=item * B<blend ($quantity)>

Generates and returns list of C<$quantity> or less compound words in the manner
explained in L</DESCRIPTION> accordingly to constraints and options being set as
the object attributes described below. If C<$quantity> is omitted, then value of
the object attribute with the same name will be used.

=item * B<load_vocabs>

Loads vocabulary lists from plain text files collecting one element per line and
stores the L</vocabs> attribute. Takes lists of files from the L</vocab_files>
attribute. Returns number of vocabularies loaded. Note that  this method invokes
automatically after object creation if L</vocabs> is empty and after each setting
of the L</vocab_files> attribute, so you will not have to call it manually.

=item * B<BUILD>

Normally, you will not have to invoke this method directly, but you might want
to override it. The C<BUILD> method is called after the object is constructed and
in the C<String::Blender> object it attempts to load vocabularies from files
specified in the L</vocab_files> attribute when no vocabularies provided directly
through the L</vocabs> attribute.

=back


=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

The following list gives a short summary of each C<String::Blender> object
attribute. All of them can be defined on object creation (see L</new>)
or set separately like follows.

    $blender->max_elements(30);
    $blender->vocabs(\@my_vocabs);


=head2 Vocabularies

=over 4

=item * B<vocabs>

Contains reference to an array of vocabularies. Each vocabulary is represented
by a reference to an array of strings, one per element. Any of those strings
should not be empty and should not contain newlines and control characters.
Being left undefined on object creation, this attribute will be set by the
L</load_vocabs> method automatically. In this case you are supposed to have the
L</vocab_files> attribute set properly.

=item * B<vocab_files>

Defines filenames and lists of filenames to read vocabularies from. Contains
reference to an array of filenames and/or references to arrays of filenames.
The L</load_vocabs> method will merge vocabularies loaded from united filenames
into a single vocabulary. After object creation this method will be invoked every
time the L</vocab_files> attribute is set. Each vocabulary file should consist
of word per line in plain text format.

=back


=head2 Constraints

=over 4

=item * B<min_length, max_length>

Define the minimum and the maximum length in characters of the resulting string.
Positive integers, dafault: 5 and 20 respectively.

=item * B<min_elements, max_elements>

Define the minimum and the maximum number of elements the resulting string should
consist of. Positive integers, dafault: 2 and 5 respectively.

=item * B<max_tries_factor>

Defines the maximum number of generation loops per </blend> as the product of
</quantity> and C<max_tries_factor> values. Positive integer, dafault: 4. For
example, if the </quantity> equals to 10, the number of generation loops will be
limited to 40.

=back


=head2 Options

=over 4

=item * B<quantity>

Defines the quantity of strings to be generated per one invocation of the L</blend>
method. Positive integer, default: 10.

=item * B<strict_order>

Concatenate string elements according to the strict order of vocabularies they
were taken from. Boolean, default: false.

=item * B<delimiter>

String to separate string elements with in each resulting string. Empty by default.

=item * B<prefix>

String to prefix each resulting string with. Empty by default.

=item * B<postfix>

String to follow each resulting string by. Empty by default.

=back


=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

There are some exceptional situations worth consideration.

=over

=item C<< Maximum tries limit exceeded (%s) >>

Normally the size of resulting list returned by the L</blend> method should be
equal to C<$quantity>. But having in mind that the method is intended to provide
a list of unique strings within certain restrictions, it becomes clear that in
some conditions there is a chance to fall into infinite loop. That's what the
L</max_tries_factor> limitation attribute stands for. When the generator runs
into narrow constraints and/or poor vocabularies, the resulting list may turn out
to be shoter then expected or even empty. In this case relevant warning will follow.
In order to avoid this you might want to increase value of the L</max_tries_factor>
attribute or weaken generation constraints such as L</min_elements>,
L</max_elements>, L</min_length>, L</max_length>.

=item C<< There are no vocabulary files specified >>

The C<load_vocabs> method will die once the L</vocab_files> attribute is not
defined or refers to an empty list.

=item C<< Could not open (close) file %s >>

L</load_vocabs> will also die being unable to open any file specified in the
L</vocab_files> attribute.

=item C<< Attribute (%s) does not pass the type constraint because: %s >>

Assigning any object attribute to a value which does not match the attribute's
type constraints will cause relevant fatal error.

=back


=head1 DEPENDENCIES

C<String::Blender> depends on the L<Moose> object system (version 0.74 or newer)
which must be installed separately.

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None reported.
